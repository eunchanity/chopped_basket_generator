# Chopped Basket Generator

A deployed app using Streamlit and Heroku that recommends a basket of 4 random ingredients based on user selection. This app imitates the mystery ingredient selection for each basket from the show "Chopped."

The app was created as part of my <a href="https://github.com/eunchanity/davids_repo/tree/master/projects/project4_chopped" target="_blank">project</a> that used natural langauge processing (NLP) and unsupervised learning to create a recommendation system.
